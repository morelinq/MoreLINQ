# MoreLINQ

LINQ to Objects is missing a few desirable features.

This project enhances LINQ to Objects with extra methods, in a manner which
keeps to the spirit of LINQ.

MoreLINQ is available for download and installation as
[NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/morelinq/).

Documentation for the stable and beta releases can be found at
[morelinq.github.io](http://morelinq.github.io/).
