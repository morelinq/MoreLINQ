# MoreLINQ

LINQ to Objects is missing a few desirable features.

This project enhances LINQ to Objects with extra methods, in a manner which
keeps to the spirit of LINQ.

MoreLINQ is available for download and installation as
[NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/morelinq/).

Documentation for the stable and beta releases can be found at
[morelinq.github.io](http://morelinq.github.io/).


## Usage

MoreLINQ can be used in one of two ways. The simplest is to just import the
`MoreLinq` namespace and all extension methods become instantly available for
you to use on the types they extend (typically some instantiation of
`IEnumerable<T>`). In some very rare instances, however, doing so can cause
conflicts with other libraries you may be using that incidentally also extend
the same type with an identically named method and signature. This happened
with MoreLINQ, for example, when Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 introduced
[`Zip`][netzip] and [MoreLINQ already had one][zip]. Starting with version 3.0
of MoreLINQ, you can reduce the potential for present (or even future)
conflicts by individually importing just the extension methods you need using
the [static imports feature introduced in C# 6][using-static]:

```c#
using static MoreLinq.Extensions.LagExtension;
using static MoreLinq.Extensions.LeadExtension;
```

In the example above, only the [`Lag`][lag] and [`Lead`][lead] extension
methods will be available in scope.

Apart from extension methods, MoreLINQ also offers regular static method
that *generate* (instead of operating on) sequences, like `Unfold`,
`Random`, `Sequence` and others. If you want to use these while statically
importing other individual extension methods, you can do so via aliasing:

```c#
using static MoreLinq.Extensions.LagExtension;
using static MoreLinq.Extensions.LeadExtension;
using MoreEnumerable = MoreLinq.MoreEnumerable;
```

In the example above, [`Lag`][lag] and [`Lead`][lead] will be available as
extension methods as well as all the regular static methods on
`MoreEnumerable` but _without_ any of the extension methods offered by
`MoreEnumerable`.

## Building

To build MoreLINQ from sources, you will need:

- [.NET Core 2.0 with SDK 2.1][dotnet-2.0-sdk-2.1]
- [Mono][mono] 5.0 if building on other platforms than Windows

Then run either `build.cmd` if building on Windows or `build.sh` if
building on macOS or a Linux distribution supported by .NET Core.

Some code in the project is generated using [T4][t4] templates. To regenerate
the code from modified templates, run `MoreLinq\tt.cmd` (Windows) or
`MoreLinq/tt.sh` depending on your platform.

Building the documentation is supported on Windows only and requires
[Sandcastle Help File Builder (SHFB)][shfb]. Executing `builddocs.cmd`
generates the documentation in the `docs/api` directory. It can be browsed
locally using any HTTP server of static files, like
[http-server][http-server].
